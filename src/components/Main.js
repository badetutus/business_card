      <p>
        👋 Hi there! I am Bade, the co-founder and business analyst at Mikada
        Teknoloji,where we bring project management and CRM systems to life with
        smart, tailor-made plug-ins! 🎉 Once upon a time, I graduated as a
        Biomedical Engineer, and even spent some time in the picturesque city of
        Heidelberg, Germany, as part of an Erasmus exchange. But somewhere along
        the way, I fell in love with code (no hard feelings, biomedical world!)
        and transformed into a front-end developer 👨‍💻. Now, I blend my passion
        for tech and business, creating solutions that make work a breeze for
        teams worldwide! Let’s connect and make things happen! 🌟
      </p>
      <h1>Interests</h1>
      <p>🎨 Creative Vibes: When I am not coding or analyzing
      data, you will likely find me with a paintbrush in hand or crafting some
      cool digital art. It is my go-to for expressing ideas beyond the screen! 🌊
      Adventure Awaits: I dabble in a bit of sailing whenever I get the chance.
      Nothing beats the feeling of the wind in your hair and the horizon in
      sight! 🚴‍♂️ And when I am on land, cycling and nature walks are my way of
      staying grounded and soaking up the great outdoors. 🎬 Cinematic Buff: I’m
      a movie enthusiast! Whether it’s a blockbuster or an indie gem, I’m all
      in. I also love diving into film festivals there is nothing like
      discovering hidden cinematic treasures.</p>
